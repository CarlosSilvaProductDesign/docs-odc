# Submenu

You can use the Submenu UI Pattern to create a menu that is contained within another menu.

**How to use the Submenu UI Pattern**

1. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for `Submenu`.

    The Submenu widget is displayed.

    ![](<images/submenu-1-ss.png>)

    If the UI widget does not display, it may be because you used a ready-made app, which deletes unused widgets from the module. To make additional widgets available in your app:

    a. Go to **Module > Manage dependencies**.

    b. Search for and select the relevant Producer, for example OutSystemsUI. Ensure Show All is selected. 

    c. On the Public elements for the selected Producer displayed on the right, ensure Show All is selected.
    
    d. Search for and select the element you want to add, and click **Apply**. 
    
    e. In Service Studio, in the Toolbox, search for the widget again.

1. From the Toolbox, drag the Submenu widget into the Main Content area of your application's screen.

    ![](<images/submenu-2-ss.png?width=800>)

    By default, the Submenu widget contains a Menu placeholder and an Items placeholder that contains a link. You can add as many Items placeholders as required. In this example we add 3 more.

1. Add the relevant content to the Menu and Items placeholders.

    In this example, we add text to the Menu placeholder, and set the links in the Items placeholders to navigate to a different pages in the app.

After following these steps and publishing the module, you can test the pattern in your app.
