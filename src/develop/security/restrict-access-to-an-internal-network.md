# Restrict Access to an Internal Network

You can tighten the security of your applications, or part of them, by only allowing the access to end users who have authenticated themselves in an IP belonging to an internal network.

You can restrict internal network access to the exposed REST APIs by setting its **Internal Access Only** property to `Yes`.
