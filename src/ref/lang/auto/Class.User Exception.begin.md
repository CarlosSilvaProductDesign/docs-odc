User Exception is a custom exception that you can raise in your logic flows. You can create your own User Exceptions as "children nodes" of the general User Exception. 

For example, you can create a User Exception named `UnavailableExternalSystem` and raise it in your logic when you detect that the external system you use to fetch data in your application is experiencing a downtime.

For more information, check [Handle Exceptions](../../../develop/logic/exceptions/intro.md).
