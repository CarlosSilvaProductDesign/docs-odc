Action to be executed when the application is returning from background to foreground (in the home module only). Can be used for validating application state when resuming (e.g. checking for network availability).  

To add this action to a Mobile or Reactive Web App do the following:

1. In the home module of your app, open the **Logic** tab.

1. Right-click the "Client Actions" node in the tree and select **Add System Event** > **On Application Resume**.
