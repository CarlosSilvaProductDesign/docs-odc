# Tutorial

Follow this tutorial to learn the basics of how to develop apps with OutSystems.

In this tutorial you will create three projects: a Web App called **Calendar** that will use **TaskList** to provide service actions of creating tasks and changing their status, along with a Library called **Timeline**.

Both TaskList and Timeline will contain reusable components available to other projects during development. 

This tutorial has three parts:

1. [Task 1: Create a Web App](tutorial-1-create-web-app.md)

1. [Task 2: Create a Library App](tutorial-2-create-library.md)

1. [Task 3: Create a calendar app](tutorial-3-create-calendar.md)

## Get started

Jump to [Task 1: Create a Web App](tutorial-1-create-web-app.md) and follow the steps to start your journey.
