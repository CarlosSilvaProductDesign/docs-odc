# Mobile apps

Project Neo lets you build mobile apps faster and for the future. With OutSystems for mobile, you can build:

* A mobile app: These are applications that users install on their phones, have access to the deviceâ€™s sensors, can work offline, and have a UX designed for a native experience.

* Mobile backend: Use OutSystems as the backend for your native mobile app, without using the traditional programming tools.
