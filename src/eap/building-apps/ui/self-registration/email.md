# Create email to send verification code

<div class="info" markdown="1">

Before you begin creating your email, make sure you have an [email provider configured](../../../configuration-management/configure-emails.md).

This article describes creating an email to send to the person registering to use your app. First, you start an email with a verification code that the person must enter on the form. To make this task easier and quicker, OutSystems provides you with a sample email. To create your email, copy the email and then make the following updates.

## Creating the email

Follow these steps to create your own email.
