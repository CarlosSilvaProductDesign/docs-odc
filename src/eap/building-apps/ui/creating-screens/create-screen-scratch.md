# Create screen from scratch

A Screen is a user interface (UI) element that contains other UI elements for users to interact. An empty Screen contains a basic layout for you to add widgets. A Screen based on a Screen Template has predefined content that works as a demo.

How Screens show in an app to you users depends on the app type:

* In a Web App, Screens render as web pages in a browser.
* In Mobile Apps, Screens render as screens of a mobile app.
