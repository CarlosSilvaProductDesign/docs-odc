# Monitor Apps

OutSystems provides a unified experience where you can monitor the health of all your applications. And then, from the same section you can identify any unexpected behaviors before they become issues that impact the performance of your systems or apps.

The goal is to reduce the effort it takes for you to:

* Detect app problems such as performance and unavailability.
* Understand whatâ€™s causing the anomaly in your application such as a configuration problem.

Using the Monitoring functions makes it easier and quicker for you to locate and fix the issues. You can use the Monitoring functions during all stages of development to monitor and troubleshoot applications. You can also access capabilities to check for application governance, user management, and performance.

Currently, the following log files are available:

* **General Log** - shows the timestamp, app name, app key, message, and source
* **Error Log** - shows the timestamp, app name, app key, message, source, and error key
* **Integration Log** - shows the timestamp, app name, app key, type, source, action, endpoint, duration, log key/ID, and the error key/ID

A detail button to the right of each log entry, provides additional information.
