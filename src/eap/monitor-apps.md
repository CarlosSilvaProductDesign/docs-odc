# Monitor Apps

OutSystems provides a unified experience where you can monitor the health of all your applications. And then, from the same section you can identify any unexpected behaviors that might impact the performance of your systems or apps.

Log files are available to help you identify a problem, determine the root cause, and then fix the problem. At the top of each log file, you can set filters to narrow the scope of your results.

Currently, the following log files are available:

**Error Log** - helps you understand errors that are occurring during runtime. This log shows the following information:

* System related issues or exceptions from an application due to issues in its logic
* Errors from user devices trying to access the app
* Security exceptions such as when an unregistered user tries to access a page

**General Log** - helps you understand the probable causes slowing down your app. This log shows the following information:

* System errors that force a process to terminate
* Application issues such as a slow query warnings
* Activity logs showing which users are logging into an app as well as publishing or deploying

**Integration Log** - helps you understand how quickly your app is responding to incoming requests and external services. This log shows the the amount of time it takes to complete an action in a given period.
